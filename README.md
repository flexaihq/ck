## Collective Knowledge

[Collective Knowledge (CK, CM, CM4MLOps, CM4MLPerf and CMX)](https://cKnowledge.org) 
is an educational community project to learn how to run AI, ML and other emerging workloads 
in the most efficient and cost-effective way across diverse models, data sets, software and hardware:
[ [white paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16791) ].

It includes the following sub-projects.

### Collective Mind (CM)

The [Collective Mind framework](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm) 
is a lightweight, Python-based toolset featuring 
a unified command-line interface (CLI), Python API, and minimal dependencies. 
It is designed to assist researchers and engineers in automating repetitive, time-consuming 
tasks such as building, running, benchmarking, and optimizing AI, machine learning, 
and other applications across diverse and continuously changing models, data, software and hardware.

Collective Mind is continuously enhanced through public and private Git repositories
with CM automation recipes and artifacts accessible via unified CM interface.

The CM architecture diagram is available for viewing 
[here](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/docs/specs/cm-diagram-v3.5.1.png).

### Notable Collective Mind repositories

#### CM4MLOps

[CM4MLOPS repository powered by CM](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm-mlops) - 
a collection of portable, extensible and technology-agnostic automation recipes
with a common CLI and Python API (CM scripts) to unify and automate 
all the manual steps required to compose, run, benchmark and optimize complex ML/AI applications 
on diverse platforms with any software and hardware. 

The two key automations are *script" and *cache*:
see [online catalog at CK playground](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=scripts),
[online MLCommons catalog](https://docs.mlcommons.org/cm4mlops/scripts).

CM scripts extend the concept of `cmake` with simple Python automations, native scripts
and JSON/YAML meta descriptions. They require Python 3.7+ with minimal dependencies and are 
[continuously extended by the community and MLCommons members](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to run natively on Ubuntu, MacOS, Windows, RHEL, Debian, Amazon Linux
and any other operating system, in a cloud or inside automatically generated containers
while keeping backward compatibility.

See the [online documentation](https://docs.mlcommons.org/inference) 
at MLCommons to run MLPerf inference benchmarks across diverse systems using CM.

#### CM4ABTF

[CM4ABTF repository powered by CM](https://github.com/mlcommons/cm4abtf) - 
a collection of portable automations and CM scripts to run the upcoming 
automotive MLPerf benchmark across different models, data sets, software 
and hardware from different vendors.

#### CM4MLPerf-results

[CM4MLPerf-results powered by CM](https://github.com/mlcommons/cm4mlperf-results) - 
a simplified and unified representation of the past MLPerf results 
in the CM format for further visualization and analysis using [CK graphs](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=experiments).

#### CM4Research

[CM4Research repository powered by CM](https://github.com/ctuning/cm4research) - 
a unified interface designed to streamline the preparation, execution, and reproduction of experiments in research projects.


### Projects powered by Collective Mind

#### Collective Knowledge Playground

[Collective Knowledge Playground](https://access.cKnowledge.org) - 
a unified and open-source platform designed to [index all CM scripts](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=scripts) similar to PYPI,
assist users in preparing CM commands to:

* [run MLPerf benchmarks](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=howtorun)
* aggregate, process, visualize, and compare [benchmarking results](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=experiments) for AI and ML systems
* organize [open, reproducible optimization challenges and tournaments](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=challenges). 

These initiatives aim to help academia and industry
collaboratively enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of AI systems.

#### Artifact Evaluation

[Artifact Evaluation automation](https://cTuning.org/ae) - a community-driven initiative 
leveraging the Collective Mind framework to automate artifact evaluation 
and support reproducibility efforts at ML and systems conferences.


## Incubator

[CMX](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cmx) - the next evolution of the Collective Mind framework,
designed to enhance simplicity, flexibility, and extensibility of automations 
based on user feedback. Follow the project's progress [here]( https://github.com/orgs/mlcommons/projects/46 ).
